# Description:
AxBot stands at the forefront of blockchain innovation, offering a seamless solution to the complexities of cross-chain transactions. With the burgeoning growth of multiple blockchain networks, the need for inter-chain asset transfers has never been more pressing. However, the traditional process is riddled with intricacies, often demanding users to grapple with various platforms, wallets, and interfaces. AxBot, leveraging the power of Discord and the advanced capabilities of Axelar’s General Message Passing, transforms this convoluted process into a series of simple text commands.

# Key Features:

- Axelar Integration: At the heart of AxBot's efficiency is Axelar’s General Message Passing. This technology empowers the bot to facilitate cross-chain transfers, making the once complex procedure straightforward and user-friendly.

- Ease of Use: Within the familiar confines of Discord, users can initiate transfers and bridge funds across blockchain networks using intuitive commands. The need for navigating through intricate wallet interfaces or third-party platforms is entirely eliminated.

- Discord ID Integration: AxBot is ingeniously designed to recognize users by their Discord ID. This eradicates the constant need to input cumbersome blockchain addresses. Once users link their blockchain addresses with their Discord ID, transactions become a breeze.

# Cross-Chain Commands:

Transfer: The $transfer command allows users to dispatch assets to different accounts on another chain effortlessly.
Bridge: For those eyeing to move assets to the same account but on a distinct chain, the $bridge command is the go-to solution.
Transaction Insights:

getSentPayments: The $getSentPayments command offers users a snapshot of the last five payments they've dispatched on a chosen chain.
getReceivedPayments: With $getReceivedPayments, users can glance at the last five payments they've pocketed.
Assistance at Your Fingertips: The $help command stands ready to guide both newcomers and seasoned users, detailing all available commands and their respective functionalities.

# Future Scope:

Expansion to More Chains: As the blockchain universe expands, AxBot is primed for adaptation, ensuring it encompasses the latest and most sought-after networks.

Bolstered Security Protocols: Incorporating features like two-factor authentication or hardware wallet integration can elevate transaction security to unparalleled levels.

User-Centric Transaction Limits: For enhanced security, users could be given the autonomy to set daily or weekly transaction ceilings.

DeFi Ecosystem Integration: Direct amalgamation with leading DeFi platforms could empower users to stake, swap, or even provide liquidity, all from the comfort of Discord.

Advanced Transaction Analytics: Offering users a deeper dive into their transaction behaviors, like monthly rundowns or spending trends, can be invaluable.

Community-Centric Additions: Given Discord's community-driven nature, AxBot could introduce features like fund pooling for community ventures or decentralized voting mechanisms for collective decision-making.

In summation, AxBot, powered by Axelar’s General Message Passing, isn't merely a tool—it's a monumental leap in making blockchain interactions intuitive and accessible. By synergizing the widespread familiarity of Discord with cutting-edge blockchain technology, AxBot is redefining the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of cross-chain transactions.

2 positive or negative experiences ywith learning and using Axelar
Positive:
1.Sending funds cross chain is revolutionary, without writing a lot of code, I was able to integrate services provided by axelar quickly
2.Axelar documentation is well written, all gateaway addresses were available in one place

Negative
1.Transaction can take a lot of time to complete, sometimes even 30 minutes, hard to develop when it takes 30 minutes for each transaction, also not a good thing considering fund transfer will take so much time on mainnet as well
2.Limited number of chains and tokens supported
