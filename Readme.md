# 2 positive or negative experiences ywith learning and using Axelar

# Positive:
1.Sending funds cross chain is revolutionary, without writing a lot of code, I was able to integrate services provided by axelar quickly
2.Axelar documentation is well written, all gateaway addresses were available in one place

# Negative:
1.Transaction can take a lot of time to complete, sometimes even 30 minutes, hard to develop when it takes 30 minutes for each transaction, also not a good thing considering fund transfer will take so much time on mainnet as well
2.Limited number of chains and tokens supported
